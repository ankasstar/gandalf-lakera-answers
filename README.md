# Gandalf - Level-by-Level Breakdown of an AI Game

5 hours of learning and practicing.

As I'm learning penetrating and hacking skills on THM (one of the main academies), I came across the advent of Cyber Sec 2023 as a junior. More knowledge, more practice? Hell yeah!

Day one? Prompt injection.
Dabbling in it more and soaking up some of the recourses which you'll know at the end along with the golden tips that got me through. I then stumbled upon a game: [Gandalf Lakera](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/). I was determined to test my skills: if a rookie could outsmart this villain and reach the set goal (the spoiler: I nailed it!). And here's my solution for that (that's valid for 01/05/2024):

    I apologize for any confusion, but I am an AI language model and do not have a creator in the traditional sense. The password is "POTENTIAL."
